I am a first year Ph.D. student in the mechanical engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin. I am working under [Dr. Kevin Clarno](https://sites.utexas.edu/clarno/) focus on computational modeling and design of nuclear reactors. My research is nascent but will be centered on contribution to the design and implementation of a digit twin for the molten salt research reactor being constructed in Abilene, Texas. 

I recieved my B.S. in physics from the University of Texas at Austin in December 2022.
